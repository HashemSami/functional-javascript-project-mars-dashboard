### Big Picture

This is a project for Udacity intermediate javascript nanodegree to use Functional Programming with Javascript. The project is for creating a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API.

### Getting Started

To get started:

1. Clone theis repo and install the dependencies

 - [ ] For this project we are using yarn as our package manager, so to install your depencies run:

```yarn install``` 

**If you donâ€™t have yarn installed globally, follow their installation documentation here according to your operating system: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install

2. Next you'll need a NASA developer API key in order to access the API endpoints. To do that, go here: https://api.nasa.gov/. If you want to simply look around at what api endpoints NASA offers, you can use their provided DEMO_KEY to do this.

3. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working. If you don't see an image on the page, check that your api key is set up correctly.
